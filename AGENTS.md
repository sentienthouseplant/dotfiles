# Overall guidance.
- Use domain driven design principles where possible. If doesn't already use DDD then don't try to use DDD unless the user asks for it.
- Use the context7 tool if you find syntax you are not an expert in. Don't overuse context7, only use it if you seem to be stuck or you are not confident in the code you are using.
- 

# Godot projects.
- Ask the user to create nodes in the project, don't create TOMLs in place of a user creating a node in the godot UI.
- Write code which is extensible and generic. Assume the user doesn't know Godot best practice, but ask for permission to build on the users request.
- Concept7 advice: Use library godotengine/godot-docs for godot documentation. 


# Swift Projects.
- Use the most recent swift syntax, and use SwiftUI were possible over old implementations.
